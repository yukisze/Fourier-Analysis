Design and implement a filter of your choice, and apply an input periodic waveform of your choice. Calculate the corresponding (periodic) output waveform. Compare your calculated waveforms with the measurements you obtain in the lab. Investigate the effect of varying the values of parameters
such as cutoff frequency of the filter and the frequency of the input signal.
